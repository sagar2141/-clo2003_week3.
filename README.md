Learning About Linux

Section 1: Introduction & Linux history:

-In 1991, Linux was developed and is a free and open-source software that operates on its own operating system. 
-The term ‘Linux’ stands for GNU + Linux. Initially developed by Linus Torvalds, it was created alongside the source code of Unix. 
-While Linux is extensively utilized for various purposes, its applications are well-known to many.
-Linux has changed a lot and is now used on servers, personal computers, and various devices. 
-It is popular because it is stable, secure, and flexible, which makes it a favorite among developers and companies around the world.

Section 2: Linux Distributions:

-A Linux distribution, or "distro," is a complete package of software that creates an operating system. Distros are made to meet different user needs, whether for servers, desktops, or embedded systems.

Each distribution has its own goals and can be customized for specific purposes. Linux distros are versatile because they are made up of several components that work together.

Here the examples of famous Linux distributions.
-Ubuntu: Easy to use and install.
-Debian: Known for being stable and having lots of software available.
-Fedora: Focuses on the latest technology and    features.
-Arch Linux: Designed for advanced users who want to customize their system.

Differences between distributions : Every distribution has its own way of working like installation, management and help available from users and can make different user experiences, these are the differences can be seen in Linux distributions.

Section 3: Basic Linux Commands:


1. Is command in Linux
-The ls command is commonly used to identify the files and directories in the working directory. This command is one of the many often-used Linux commands that you should know.

2. pwd command in Linux
-The pwd command is mostly used to print the current working directory on your terminal. It is also one of the most commonly used commands. 

Now, your terminal prompt should usually include the entire directory. If it doesn’t, this is a quick command to see which directory you’re in. Another purpose for this command is when creating scripts because it can help us find the directory in which the script was saved. The below pictures are the output with the command.

3. cd Command in Linux
The cd command lets you switch between folders. You can enter the full path or just the folder name, depending on where you are. If you type cd by itself, it takes you to your home folder. Only users with special permissions (sudo) can use this command.

4. mkdir Command in Linux
The mkdir command is for creating new folders in the terminal. To create a folder, type mkdir <folder name>, and it will make that folder.

5. cp Command in Linux
The cp command works like the copy-paste feature in Windows. It allows you to copy files or folders.

6. mv Command in Linux
The mv command is used mainly for renaming files. You can also use it to move files to a different place.

7. rm Command in Linux
The rm command deletes files from a folder. Be careful with this command because once you delete a file, it’s hard to get it back.

8. ps Command in Linux
The ps command shows you a list of processes that are currently running in the terminal. It helps you see what tasks are active.

Conclusion
To sum up, this document covered the history of Linux, different versions (distributions), and some basic commands. Knowing how to use Linux is a useful skill that can lead to opportunities in IT, software development, and system management, as it runs a large part of the internet and many business systems.
